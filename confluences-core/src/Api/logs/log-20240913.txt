To identify the query that's triggering this warning call 'ConfigureWarnings(w => w.Throw(RelationalEventId.MultipleCollectionIncludeWarning))'.

Consider removing the 'AddEntityFramework*' call, as in most cases it's not needed and may cause conflicts with other products and services registered in the same service provider.
